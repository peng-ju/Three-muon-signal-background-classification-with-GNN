# Three-muon-signal-background-classification-with-GNN

The aim of this project is to distinguish the signal from background for the three-moun experient. For this purpose, we build a GNN (graph neural network) based classifier with a recall rate of 0.92.

The physics process is explained in the paper ''.

The experiment is explained in 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermilab_E-906/SeaQuest'


# Root2PKL

Root2PKL import the similated data and extracct select features for the GNN classification model.
